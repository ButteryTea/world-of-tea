                        After realizing the medicinal benefits of tea to a person's health, the emperor then urged the Chinese people

                        and drink of the Chinese culture.

                        Tea was originally used as an ingredient for medicinal herbs and seasoning for different dishes. It only 
                        shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago in China when the people realized that a combination of heat and 
                        moisture could create a variety of complex flavors from the plant.

                        As China became the leading export of tea (along with silk and porcelain), the Dutch traders discovered the

                        quantities through trading in different countries - including England.
